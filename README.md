# ConsoleToast

An example of a .NET Console application that creates a Windows 10 Toast Notification. The notification appears in the Windows 10 Action Center's Notification window.

The implementation was inspired by [this example of creating a toast notification using PowerShell](https://gist.github.com/altrive/72594b8427b2fff16431)
